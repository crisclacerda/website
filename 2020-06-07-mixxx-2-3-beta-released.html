Please test it, [report bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+filebug), help [translate](https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/internationalization), and [contribute controller mappings](https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/contributing_mappings). If you want help make Mixxx even more awesome, introduce yourself on our [Zulip chat](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/109123-introduce-yourself) and read the [developer documentation](https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php#developer_documentation).

A brief overview of the changes is below. In the coming weeks, we will be publishing a series of posts on this blog discussing the new features in more depth, so stay tuned!

## Hotcues ##
* Add hotcue colors and custom labels by right clicking hotcue buttons or right clicking hotcues on waveforms (both overview and scrolling waveforms) [#2016](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2016) [#2520](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2520) [#2238](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2238) [#2560](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2560) [#2557](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2557) [#2362](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2362)
* Mouse hover cues on overview waveform to show time remaining until the cue [#2238](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2238)

## Hotcue & Track Colors ##
* Add configurable color per track [#2470](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2470) [#2539](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2539) [#2545](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2545) [#2630](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2630) [lp:1100882](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1100882)
* Add customizable color palettes for hotcue and track colors [#2530](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2530) [#2589](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2589)
* Add hotcue color find-and-replace tool [#2547](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2547)

## Importing From Other DJ Software ##
* Import cue points, track colors, and playlists from Serato file tags & database [#2480](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2480) [#2526](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2526) [#2499](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2499) [#2495](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2495) [#2673](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2673)
    * Note: Mixxx does not yet support multiple loops per track. We are [working on this for Mixxx 2.4](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2194). In Mixxx 2.3, if you import a track with multiple loops from Serato, Mixxx will use the first loop cue as the single loop Mixxx currently supports. The imported loops are still stored in Mixxx's database and are treated as hotcues in Mixxx 2.3. If you do not delete these hotcues, they will be usable as loops in Mixxx 2.4. Serato keeps loops and hotcues in separate lists, but Mixxx does not, so loops from Serato are imported starting as hotcue 9.
* Import cue points, track colors, and playlists from Rekordbox USB drives [#2119](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2119) [#2555](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2555) [#2543](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2543) [#2779](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2779)
    * Note: The first Rekordbox memory cue is imported for the main cue button in Mixxx and the remaining Rekordbox memory cues are imported as Mixxx hotcues, starting with the next hotcue number after the last hotcue from Rekordbox.
    * Note: Mixxx does not yet support multiple loops per track. Imported loops from Rekordbox are treated like imported loops from Serato, so refer to the note above for details.

## Intro & Outro Cues ##
* Add intro & outro range cues with automatic silence detection [#1242](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1242)
* Show duration of intro & outro ranges on overview waveform [#2089](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2089)
* Use intro & outro cues in AutoDJ transitions [#2103](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2103)

## Deck cloning ##
* Add deck cloning (also known as "instant doubles" in other DJ software) by dragging and dropping between decks [#1892](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1892)
* Clone decks by double pressing the load button on a controller (with option to disable this) [#2024](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2024) [#2042](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2042)

## Skins & GUI ##
* Aesthetically revamped LateNight skin [#2298](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2298) [#2342](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2342)
* Right click overview waveform to show time remaining until that point [#2238](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2238)
* Show track context menu when right clicking text in decks [#2612](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2612) [#2675](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2675) [#2684](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2684) [#2696](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2696)
* Add laptop battery widget to skins [#2283](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2283) [#2277](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2277) [#2250](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2250) [#2228](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2228) [#2221](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2221) [#2163](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2163) [#2160](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2160) [#2147](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2147) [#2281](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2281) [#2319](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2319) [#2287](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2287)
* Show when passthrough mode is active on overview waveforms [#2575](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2575) [#2616](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2616)

## Music Feature Analysis ##
* Multithreaded analysis for much faster batch analysis on multicore CPUs [#1624](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1624) [#2142](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2142) [lp:1641153](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1641153)
* Fix bugs affecting key detection accuracy [#2137](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2137) [#2152](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2152) [#2112](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2112) [#2136](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2136)
    * Note: Users who have not manually corrected keys are advised to clear all keys in their library by pressing Ctrl + A in the library, right clicking, going to Reset -> Key, then reanalyzing their library. This will freeze the GUI while Mixxx clears the keys; this is a known problem that we will not be able to fix for 2.3. Wait until it is finished and you will be able to reanalyze tracks for better key detection results.

* Include LAME MP3 encoder with Mixxx now that the MP3 patent has expired [lp:1294128](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1294128) [buildserver:#37](https://github.com/mixxxdj/buildserver/pull/37) [buildserver:9e8bcee](https://github.com/mixxxdj/buildserver/commit/9e8bcee771731920ae82f3e076d43f0fb51e5027)
